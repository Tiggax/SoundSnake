audible python frontend GUI for downloading and converting and maintaining audible files


the frontend was "forked" from [Wanderson](https://github.com/Wanderson-Magalhaes/PyOneDark_Qt_Widgets_Modern_GUI). most of the qt end was learnt watching his youtube vids. 
if you are interested in QT i recommend watching some of his [vids](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy1fv5dh3wQEem1nFAUBJzw)
